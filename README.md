# fitNMDS
Measures of fit for bootstrapped and reciprocal NMDS.

Combining two different datasets into one nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) model can be risky if they each cover different
attribute spaces (e.g., different species pools in ecology). Therefore, comparing two datasets requires estimating internal fit
(stability) relative to external fit (exchangeability). Bootstrapped NMDS estimates internal fit of a candidate dataset, while 
reciprocal NMDS estimates external fit of two candidate datasets.
